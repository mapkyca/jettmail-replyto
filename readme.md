Elgg Jettmail Reply-to email address functionality
==================================================

This is a plugin that sits along side jettmail <https://github.com/jumbojett/jettmail> and creates a direct reply-to email address for object notifications.

This provides a full email bridge, allowing elgg users to receive and reply to messages (comments, group forum posts etc) directly from their email client

Installation
------------

 * Install the plugin into your /mod directory and activate it.
 * To return registration back to normal simply deactivate the plugin.
 
Note: The plugin must appear in the plugin list before the jettmail plugin and notifications, but this should be enforced by the plugin manifest.
